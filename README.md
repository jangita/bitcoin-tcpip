# bitcoing-tcpip
Connect to the bitcoin network and retrieve one transaction information

There is all this talk about bitcoin and blockchain with the structure, how mining works etc, but very few documents or information on how the tcp/ip protocol actually works. This is my attempt on low level connection onto the bitcoin blockchain network
